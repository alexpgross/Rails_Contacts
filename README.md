# Contacts

This is a simple Contacts manager built in Ruby on Rails with Active Record as part of [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/).

You can: Create contacts, Read contacts, Update contacts, Destroy contacts and List contacts.

Before running the app, run 'bundle install' to install the necessary Gems, 'rake db:create' to create your database, and then 'rake db:schema:load' to load the database schema.

To start the app, initialize your server by running 'rails s' and then navigate your browser to 'http://localhost:3000/contacts'

Enjoy :)
